Predicting stress using wearable sensors (Nurses)


1 Project Description
You’re a data scientist in a company that has developed a wearable watch with multiple sensors. The company
is trying to develop a new feature that involves alerting a user when it detects that they’re getting stressed and
has asked you to investigate whether this is possible with the sensors that are currently available on the device.
For this, the company has run an experiment with nurses in a hospital, in which the nurses wore the watch
for periods of time and reported their corresponding levels of stress. You have been given access to the Nurse
stress data set and your manager has asked you to investigate whether this new feature can be implemented
using the available sensors. The company is particularly worried about false negatives, as they are trying to
convince the hospital to sign a contract with them and this is conditional on having high recall.
The report describing the data set and containing instructions on how to access it is available here [1].
You need to show that you understand the signals that are being recorded, how to properly process them
and find out whether and how they can be used to detect and/or forecast stress so that you can make a
recommendation to the company and present your results concisely, paying special attention to how the
algorithm is making the decision and which of the signals can and cannot be used for this task.
Read the following tasks in detail and make sure you understand the project.
